## Description 👨‍💻

I use Notion to organize my movies, anime, and manga that I want to watch later and write review about them. I usually look for some information about the media such as synopsis, authors and directors and some illustrative image, but this is boring, so I remembered that I'm a programmer.

## Tools ⭐

- ☄️ openai API - request some info.
- ☄️ Notion Client - Integration my datas.
- ☄️ Google APIs - (Custom Search) to search images.
- ☄️ inquirer - help with terminal inputs.
